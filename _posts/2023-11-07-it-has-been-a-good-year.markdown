It has been quite a while since I've updated the blog, over a year actually. Not much to update really. Most of my hobbies changed to do gaming, retro gaming, some streams here and there and enjoying a couple of trips like when we went to New York to the Pokemon GO Fest 2023 and a couple others.

We're still living in an apartment but hopefully 2024 bring us the chance to be home owners.

So hope you ya'll doing great. And let's see what life has coming in our way.

Cheers
