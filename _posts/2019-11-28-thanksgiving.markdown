I just came here to say happy thanksgiving. This also marks the first time I'm spending this holiday as a full time employee in the States.

So we're planning on celebrating our daughter Sara's third birthday with a small family gathering who are visiting us from Mexico and looking forward for December to visit our hometown.

Happy holidays!
