Ok after some time of having free hosting at Digital Ocean mixing my previous blog at Medium redirecting with DNS.

I decided to go all free as in beer with Github Pages, destroyed my Ubuntu droplet and started moving the DNS over.

The most tricky part was the custom name redirection with Github Pages, I had to use a third party solution at Cloudflare.

So after a few hours I'm back, and also decided to place my CV as my landing page.

Cheers!
