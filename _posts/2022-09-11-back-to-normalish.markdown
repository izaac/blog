After a a little over 2 years we went through a pandemic, we had to isolate ourselves for one of those years. It was a difficult time as we couldn't visit our families or do activities with Sara outside she was so little when all this happen so we stayed at home and did our best to give her the normalcy we could give her.

Time went by and now things feel a lot better, we're now able to do most of the things we did before the pandemic started and I am now working at SUSE, as Rancher was acquired by SUSE not long ago. I am working permanently from home doing what I like best doing computer stuff breaking thing to make them better.

Hope you all are doing better as well and stay safe.
